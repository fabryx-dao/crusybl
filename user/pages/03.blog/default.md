# 191230-31 Night Dream

I was tinkering in some kind of Gordon Matta Clark broken architectural masonry... maybe hiding from something but I don’t recall any anxiety.

Then my dad showed up. Our relationship hasn’t changed but I didn’t feel any animus towards him. We ended up in his metallic brown van with brown leather interior and carpet. I drove, for some reason. We picked up my highschool friends in an above ground concrete parking tower. Christian, Ryan, Prince. They thought the van was rad. I didn’t disagree. None of my “fancy” Vancouver friends were there, though. I think we took it on a ferry boat of some sort. I recall some queuing, but I think it was on foot.

I was at my Nana’s house with Ryan. Strange vibes. Waiting for something. There was atop big NFL football and a weird show-box shaped college ball that spin surprisingly well. We didn’t throw them around. Then Maud showed up and took her first steps. The environment mutated into a sort of disco for children and she was walking all over the place while I recorded her with my phone to show Violette. I was so proud.
